            Water buckets used to carry water
            Household and garden buckets used for carrying liquids and granular products
            Elaborate ceremonial or ritual buckets constructed of bronze, ivory or other materials, found in several ancient or medieval cultures, sometimes known by the Latin for bucket, situla
            Large scoops or buckets attached to loaders and telehandlers for landscaping agricultural and purposes
